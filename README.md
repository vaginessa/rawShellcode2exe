rawShellcode2exe
================

converts raw shellcode to exe

shellcode2exe is publically available but the problem I faced was this tool
took .bin file as input shellcode
so I scripted a tool to convert my raw shellcode to convert to EXE with the help of the publically available tool shellcode2exe.py
____
Usage: keep shellcode2exe.py in the same folder as this file
#convertShellcode2exe.py (file name)
